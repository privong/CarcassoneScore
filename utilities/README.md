# Miscellaneous Utilities

Scripts in this directory should not be needed during normal use, but may be helpful if problems are encountered.
Backing up the `CarcassonneScore.db` file is highly recommended, prior to running any of these.

* `merge_games.py` - A script to merge turns and scores from multiple gameIDs into a single gameID. This is useful if the scoring program crashes during play (as there is currently no way to resume games).
